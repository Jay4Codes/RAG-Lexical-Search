# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

At Instagram, we are committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. We believe in creating an environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and has equal opportunities for personal and professional growth. Our dedication to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is ingrained in our culture and is a driving force behind everything we do.

## Our Commitment

We recognize the importance of diversity in driving innovation, creativity, and success. Our commitment to DEI extends to all aspects of our organization, including our employees, users, and the broader community. We are committed to:

1. **A Culture of Inclusion:** We actively promote a culture of inclusion where everyone's voice is heard, and diverse perspectives are valued. We embrace individual differences and strive to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable and accepted.

2. **Equity and Fairness:** We are dedicated to ensuring equity and fairness in all our practices, including hiring, promotion, and compensation. We believe that everyone should have equal opportunities to thrive and succeed.

3. **Diverse Workforce:** We actively seek to build a diverse workforce that reflects the communities we serve. We are committed to attracting, retaining, and developing talent from all backgrounds, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.

4. **Inclusive Products and Features:** We strive to develop inclusive products and features that meet the needs of our diverse user base. We value feedback from our community and continuously work to enhance accessibility and inclusivity within our platform.

5. **Partnerships and Collaboration:** We believe in the power of partnerships and collaboration to drive positive change. We actively collaborate with organizations and communities that share our commitment to DEI to amplify our impact and create lasting change.

## Our Initiatives

To translate our commitment into action, we have implemented various initiatives focused on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion:

1. **Diverse Hiring:** We have implemented strategies to ensure diverse candidate pools and unbiased hiring processes. We actively recruit talent from underrepresented communities and provide equal opportunities for all applicants.

2. **Employee Resource Groups:** We support Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that provide a platform for employees to connect, share experiences, and create a sense of belonging. Our ERGs foster a culture of inclusion and contribute to our DEI efforts.

3. **Training and Education:** We provide ongoing training and education to our employees to promote awareness and understanding of unconscious bias, privilege, and systemic racism. We believe that education is essential in creating an inclusive and equitable workplace.

4. **Diverse Content:** We are committed to featuring diverse content creators, artists, and voices on our platform. We actively highlight diverse perspectives to ensure our users have a rich and inclusive experience on Instagram.

## Our Journey

We acknowledge that diversity, equity, and inclusion are ongoing journeys. We are continuously learning, evolving, and seeking feedback to improve our practices and initiatives. We are dedicated to fostering an environment where everyone feels included, valued, and empowered to contribute their best.
