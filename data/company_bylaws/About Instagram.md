# About Instagram

**Overview**

Instagram is a popular social media platform that allows users to share photos, videos, and stories with their followers. Launched in 2010, Instagram quickly gained widespread popularity due to its user-friendly interface and focus on visual content. The platform was acquired by Facebook in 2012 but has since maintained its own distinct identity and features. Instagram is more than just a social media platform—it's a vibrant community where users can connect, create, and be inspired.

**History**

Instagram was founded by Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom in 2010. The platform started as a simple photo-sharing app but quickly gained traction among users, attracting millions of users within a short span of time. In 2012, Instagram caught the attention of Facebook, leading to its acquisition. Since then, Instagram has grown exponentially, introducing new features like Stories, Direct messaging, Explore, IGTV, and Reels to enhance the user experience and expand the possibilities of visual storytelling.
